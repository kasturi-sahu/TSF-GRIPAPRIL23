In this regression task we will predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.


## Summary Of the Data
- We have 25 rows and 2 columns. 
- 1 column is the name of the Scores (Integer data type)
- 1 column is the name of the Hours (Float data type)
- There is no missing or null data
- There is no duplicate row

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

There is a positive linear relation between the number of hours studied and percentage of score. Number of study hours increases, corresponding scores also increases

## What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

The predicted score if a person studies for 9.25 hours would be 92.91505723
